# not_another_slackbot
Yet another slack bot template! Thanks to https://github.com/rapidloop/mybot for reference material. This particular slack bot uses github.com/gorilla/websocket for the websocket wrapper. Fork, copy, redistribute this code to your hearts content!

Usage: 

- Place your slack authorization token in a text file and pass that file name in as a program argument
- Fill out the channel codes and the message handling to your liking
